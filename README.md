# What is this?

This is a todo app buit on next js that uses indexed db as the database. All the data is local to your browser. There is no sign up required. I personally use this on my phone to get my shit done everyday. The goal was to make a simple to do list with only one input field that can create tasks with due dates, priorities, and labels. The inspiration was Todoist, because I love how you can create complicated tasks with just one input field. I did not want to pay $8 a month either, so this was my solution to everything I need from a usable everyday to do list that is free. Since there is no sign up or cloud, you can only use one device for the to do list. I would love to hear from anyone if they have any ideas on how to sync between devices.
